# misc-projects
Collection of projects without any real-world application or practical value. Good for sharpening your programming and problem-solving skills. Implemented in Python.

`100_prisoners.py`.  The [100 prisoners problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/100_prisoners_problem) is explained in detail in the Wikipedia article. Try to replicate the solution presented there and achieve the same success probability of 0.31183. Uses `tqdm` module for the progress bar.

`squid_game.py`. Spoiler alert! Skip this if you have not watched [this masterpiece](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Squid_Game) yet. The Glass Bridge game ([S1.E7](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt15215462/)) is well-explained in [this Medium article](https://medium.com/@lakshayakula/the-squid-game-glass-bridge-game-explained-with-probability-138371d77b52). Try to replicate the mathematical solution from the article with a simulation. What is the probability that at least one player survives? The probability that all players survive? *n*-th player? Assume that the game is played fairly and in an optimal way. The `squid_game.py` uses `tqdm` module for the progress bar and `tabulate` for pretty-printing the results.
